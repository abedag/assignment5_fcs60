      <h3>The beach</h3>

      <p>
        My favorite place is the beach because I love swimming in the sea 
        and riding horses along the shore. The wide open space makes it perfect
         for these activities, giving me a strong feeling of freedom.
          Being there helps me relax and enjoy nature at its best.
